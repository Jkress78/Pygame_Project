# Pygame_Project

This is a simple project of mine that I created while learning python and pygame. I based the game of off the Atari classic Space Invaders, 
the player is at the bottom of the screen and can only move side to side. The goal of the game is to "catch" all of the pokemon by throwing balls at them while avoiding being hit by them and their attacks. The files are split into separate folders, all of the image files are in the "img" folder, music and sound effects in "sfx", and all of the source code in "src".
